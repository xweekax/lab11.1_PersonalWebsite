		<h2>A little about Jim</h2>
		<p>Jim is an avid gardener and enjoys being outside working with the earth. He also has a passion for raising bees and chickens on his property.
		If you want to find him, just check the backyard and likely that is where he will be. With just over an acre of land he has been able to sustainably feed himself
		</p>
		<h2>Who is Jim?</h2>
		<p>So glad you asked that question, lets take a moment to answer. Jim is a multitalented software developer in training with a keen eye for detail.
		Currently he is sharpening his skill with C# and HTML but isnt just limited to these two items. Jim's experience in the tech field goes back over 20 years.
		Professionally he has held many roles in the tech support field and recently has left the field to persue software development
		</p>
		<h2>Why Jim?</h2>
		<p>A better question would be "Why not Jim?" because we can't think of any good reasons why you wouldn't want Jim on your team!
		He grew up in the small farming town of Avoca with ambition to large to be contained by that one horse town. From there he moved off to the big city for a few years to become more worldly.
		moving back to the country was always on his mind however and eventually he got back! Now he works full time remote from his homestead in Columbus MI
